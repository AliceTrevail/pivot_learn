# pivot_learn

This repository contains material developed for a microteach (10 minute lesson) on data manipulation in R:
  - code for a shiny app to explore the R tidyverse function pivot_longer()
  - presentation slides that accompany the shiny app

The app allows users to enter column names to populate pivot_longer() code, to facilitate learning without requirements for specific software and package installation

The app can be accessed via: alicetrevail.shinyapps.io/pivot_learn
